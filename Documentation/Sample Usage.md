This query will display the following columns:
- `_time`: The timestamp of the request.
- `clientip`: The IP address of the client.
- `method`: The HTTP request method (GET, POST, etc.).
- `uri`: The requested URI.
- `status`: The HTTP status code.
- `bytes`: The response size.

3. Hit **Enter** to execute the query and review the search results. You should see your web server logs displayed in a table format.

## Step 4: Add the Search to a Dashboard

1. After running the search query, click the **Save As** button above the search results.
2. Select **Dashboard Panel** from the dropdown menu.
3. In the **Create Dashboard Panel** window:
- Choose an existing dashboard or create a new one (e.g., "Web Server Logs").
- Give the panel a title, such as "Web Server Logs Overview".
4. Click **Save** to add the search results as a panel to your dashboard.

Now, the web server log search results will be part of your dashboard, making it easier to access and visualize the logs.

## Step 5: Record a Screen Capture

For reference, I have recorded a screen capture that walks through the steps outlined in this document. The video will show:

- How to create and upload the sample web server log.
- How to perform the search query in Splunk.
- How to add the search results to a dashboard.

You can view the recorded video [here](insert-link-to-video).

## Conclusion

You have now successfully uploaded a sample web server log to Splunk, searched for the data using a Splunk query, and added the results to a dashboard for better visualization. Refer to the video tutorial for additional guidance.

If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to reach out to the support team or consult the official Splunk documentation.
